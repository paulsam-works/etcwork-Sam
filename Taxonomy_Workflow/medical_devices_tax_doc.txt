A medical device taxonomy can be structured in several ways, most commonly using a combination of risk-based classification (e.g., by regulatory bodies like the FDA or EU MDR) and functional or specialty-based categories. 
I. Risk-Based Classification (FDA/CDSCO/EU MDR Model)
This is the primary regulatory taxonomy, categorizing devices based on the potential risk they pose to the patient/user. 
Class I / Class A (Lowest Risk): General controls are sufficient to ensure safety and effectiveness.
Examples:
Bandages, wound dressings
Manual stethoscopes, tongue depressors
Hospital beds, non-electric wheelchairs
Reusable surgical instruments (Class Ir in EU)
Specimen transport media
Class II / Class B (Moderate/Low-Moderate Risk): General controls are insufficient, requiring special controls or performance standards.
Examples:
Syringes, hypodermic needles
Blood pressure cuffs/monitors
Catheters, infusion pumps
Diagnostic ultrasound equipment
Surgical gloves
Class III / Class C & D (Highest Risk): Devices that support or sustain human life, are implanted long-term, or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
Examples:
Pacemakers, artificial heart valves
Implanted prosthetics (e.g., breast implants, orthopedic implants)
Defibrillators
High-frequency ventilators
Aneurysm clips 
II. Specialty or Functional Area Taxonomy
Devices can also be categorized by the medical specialty they are used in or their function. 
Anesthesiology & Respiratory: Anesthesia machines, ventilators, oxygen masks, nebulizers
Cardiovascular: Pacemakers, catheters, blood pressure monitors, artificial heart valves
Dental: Dental implants, instruments, and other related products
Diagnostics/Imaging: X-ray machines, MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment, in vitro diagnostics (IVDs), blood glucose meters
Gastroenterology & Urology: Endoscopes, catheters, rectal balloons
Neurology: Neurostimulators, neurological electrodes
Orthopedics: Artificial joints, bone fixation implants, braces, supports
General Hospital/Surgical: Surgical instruments (scalpels, forceps), hospital beds, gloves, masks, syringes, infusion pumps 
III. Example Hierarchical Product Taxonomy
A practical product taxonomy for a business might combine these approaches:
Category Level 1: Cardiovascular Devices
Category Level 2: Diagnostic
Product: Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor (Class IIa/B)
Product: Blood pressure cuff (Class IIa/B)
Category Level 2: Therapeutic
Product: Pacemaker (Class III/D)
Product: Cardiovascular catheter (Class III/D, if long term/invasive)
Category Level 1: Orthopedic Implants
Category Level 2: Joint Replacement
Product: Hip prosthetic (Class III/D)
Category Level 2: Fixation Devices
Product: Bone screws/plates (Class IIb/C)
